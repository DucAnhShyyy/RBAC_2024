# 📈 Consumer Loan Analytics & Forecasting | SHB Finance Case Study

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project was developed for the **RMIT Business Analytics Champion 2024**, Round 2. Our team analyzed and modeled consumer loan data from **SHB Finance**, aiming to deliver actionable insights and strategic recommendations for improving loan services and customer segmentation in the post-COVID context.

We applied a **data-driven approach** to deeply understand:
- Who SHB Finance’s customers are
- What they borrow for
- How these patterns have evolved post-pandemic
- And how we can forecast or improve their credit strategies

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze customer demographics and credit behavior.
- Identify trends and correlations in loan characteristics.
- Segment customers using unsupervised learning (K-means).
- Provide data-backed business recommendations for loan strategy, risk management, and promotion.

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Time Period**: 2022–2023
- **Source**: SHB Finance internal consumer lending data
- **Core Features**:
  - Customer age, income, education sector
  - Credit scores & loan purposes
  - Loan term, interest rate, amount, disbursement date

---

## 📌 Key Insights

### 1. Customer Profiles
- Majority of customers are aged **25–50**, with **upper-middle income** (15–20M VND/month).
- Most loans are taken for **shopping**, followed by **education** and **vehicles**.
- Credit scores are mostly **average**, indicating a stable but cautious lending base.

### 2. Loan Characteristics
- **Mid- to long-term loans (>1 year)** dominate in both volume and value.
- Interest rates rose across the board in 2023, yet **loan amounts still increased**, especially in **education**.
- **Lower interest rates correlate with higher loan amounts**, revealing trust-based loan policies.

### 3. Year-over-Year Trends
- **Education loans grew by 74% in 2023**, while **travel loans dropped sharply**.
- **December dips** in loan amounts across both years, likely due to economic pressures and interest rate peaks.

### 4. Behavioral & Correlation Analysis
- Positive correlation: **Age, Income, and Loan Amount**
- Negative correlation: **Interest Rate and Loan Amount**

## 🔍 Modeling & Forecasting

### 📦 Clustering: K-Means for Customer Segmentation
We applied **K-Means Clustering** to:
- Segment customers by demographics and borrowing behavior.
- Optimize marketing and risk strategies per segment.
- Drive personalized loan product offerings.

### 🧮 Proposed Features
- Normalized loan amount, income range
- Credit score category (mapped)
- Loan purpose and duration
- Age group & education sector

### 🔁 Potential Model Extensions (Beyond Round 2)
- Predictive modeling for default risk (Logistic Regression, XGBoost)
- Time series forecasting for seasonal trends
- Optimization modeling for interest rate scenario planning

## 💡 Business Recommendations

### 🎯 Strategic Decisions
1. **Lower interest rates** for growing segments: Education, Healthcare, and Vehicle loans.
2. **Focus marketing** on the **20–24 age group**, which doubled their education loan contracts YoY.
3. **Offer tailored loan packages** with flexible terms (24–30 months) for young adults and high-value loans.

### 🔐 Risk Management
- Use **segmentation for smarter credit scoring** and pre-approval logic.
- Adjust policies based on behavioral clusters for better NPL (non-performing loan) control.
